riot.tag2('future_modules', '<div class="page_container" style=""> <h1>UCosmic Future Modules</h1> <h2>Alumni</h2> <p> The University of Cincinnati investigated creating an alumni module in 2006, as a candidate for one of the very first modules to be developed. However we discovered that alumni data was not very easy to get into UCosmic. Your institution may have policies which aim to prevent unauthorized parties from contacting alumni members. Before requesting features for this module, please check with your foundation and/or Alumni Association to discover what policies may exist regarding sharing of alumni information with you and UCosmic. Report what you discover to the Feedback & Support forum. <br> Today, it is not uncommon for professionals to advertise their education information in social apps such as Facebook and LinkedIn. UC\'s Alumni Association is already leveraging the social graph with a Facebook page for UC Alums. <br> It is possible, with the user\'s consent, to use Application Programming Interfaces (API\'s) from systems like Facebook and LinkedIn to help UCosmic connect you with alumni around the world. There is also an underlying corollary with the Faculty Pedigree component of the Faculty & Staff module. Consider an employee at Lehigh University who graduated with a PhD from Edinburgh Napier University. When she enters her faculty pedigree information for Lehigh, Edinburgh Napier can now use the same data for its Alumni module. </p> <h2>Representatives</h2> <p> There are 5 components to the Representatives module: </p> <ol style="margin: 15px;
